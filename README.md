## Learning Points
This was a tough assignment. First learning and understanding how React works but also training my eyes and mind to put pieces together to create a proper rendering. It wasn't always successful, but this is a great learning opportunity and I cannot wait to see where I am at in a few months when I revisit this assignment and tinker with it some more.
